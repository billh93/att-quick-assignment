## Instructions For HTML/Javascript assignment
1. Download the zip to a directory you'll be working in.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Open any folder in a modern browser.
4. If you are opening react1 or react2 make sure to have npm installed.
5. Install npm by going to organizations link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
6. After installing npm `cd react1`.
7. Start the server by typing: `npm start`.
8. Your browser should automatically open to the project.

## Instructions For Perl assignment
1. Download the zip to a directory you'll be working in.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Open the perl folder using your command line.
4. Make sure you have perl installed on your computer.
5. Type `chmod +x db.pl` to give permission to run the file.
6. Type `./db.pl` to create the database.
7. Type `chmod +x table.pl` to give permission to run the file.
8. Type `./table.pl` to create the table.
9. Repeat the instructions for the last two files.
10. First `insert.pl` and then `select.pl`.
11. You should get the output of the database in your cli/terminal.

## Notes
I only completed the bonus part of the assignment using vanilla JS and jQuery.
React is self explanatory and easily able to insert the table using components.
